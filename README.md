# bbgwGPS

A toptechboy.com documentation on the BBGW (BeagleBone Green Wireless) made by me...

...

This software can be used only w/ Python2 and not Python3 for whatever reason. 
If you try it out w/ Python3 and make it work, more power to you and Godspeed.

...

The kml wrapper in the GPS_data directory can be used as is in GoogleEarth for displaying
your location and your path taken.

Also, that other file, the .txt file in the GPS_data directory, will fill with your location
or past locations when you run the GPS.py file on your BeagleBone Green Wireless.

...

In theory, you can set up a .service file to run on boot so that the GPS.py file runs and 
follows you constantly. 

    I have a Grove Connector GPS device on the UART2 channel on the BBGW by BeagleBoard.org
    and Seeed-Studio. Once upon a time, the two of those entities came together to produce this 
    BBBW but w/ the Green heading for some reason. Although different, it works and it is a nice 
    board.

...

If you are having troubles running this software from toptechboy.com and that Mr. Paul fellow 
that initially typed up this source code, please do not hesitate to contact me.

P.S. That is all for now.
